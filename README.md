# nsb-pcm
nsb-pcm (Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq with phase-change material) solves the incompressible NSB equations coupled with an enthalpy-based energy equation allowing for melting and solidification of the phase-change material medium.

This is written in C++ and based on the deal.II finite element method library.
