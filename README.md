# nsb-pcm

The development of this code has just begun, starting from a copy of the author's convection-diffusion code at https://github.com/alexanderzimmerman/peclet

nsb-pcm (Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq with phase-change material) will solve the incompressible NSB equations coupled with an enthalpy-based energy equation allowing for melting and solidification of the phase-change material medium.

This is written in C++ and based on the deal.II finite element method library.
